# ChatGPT Starter

This is a simple starter app that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate text based on a prompt. You can use this app as a starting point for building your own ChatGPT-powered chatbot or conversational interface.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/chatgpt-starter.git
cd chatgpt-starter

Then, install the dependencies:
npm install

npm start
``

The app will prompt you for a message, and then generate a response using OpenAI's ChatGPT API.

You can customize the prompt, model, and maximum number of tokens by editing the index.js file. You'll need to provide your own OpenAI API key in order to use the ChatGPT API. You can either set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, or create a .env file in the project directory and set it there.
